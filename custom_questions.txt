        "question": "What are the key features of the Amazon rainforest?",
        "context": "The Amazon rainforest spans across nine countries in South America and is home to a rich ecosystem. It serves as a significant carbon sink and helps regulate the Earth's climate. <p>The Amazon rainforest, also known as Amazonia, is a vast tropical rainforest in South America that covers over 5.5 million square kilometers. It is known for its incredible biodiversity, hosting millions of species of plants, animals, and insects. The Amazon River, one of the largest rivers in the world, runs through the forest, contributing to the rich ecosystem.</p> However, human activities like deforestation and mining threaten its biodiversity.",

        "question": "How does photosynthesis work in plants?",
        "context": "Photosynthesis is a vital process for life on Earth, enabling plants to convert sunlight into energy. It is closely linked to the carbon cycle. <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll captures sunlight. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil react in the presence of sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen.</p> Plants also produce oxygen as a byproduct, which supports life on Earth.",

        "question": "What were the main causes of World War I?",
        "context": "World War I involved numerous nations and resulted in significant geopolitical changes. It was one of the most devastating conflicts in history. <p>World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 and lasted until 1918.

        "question": "What are the effects of global warming on polar regions?",
        "context": "Polar regions are critical indicators of climate change, and their warming has far-reaching implications for global weather patterns and ecosystems. <p>Global warming has significant effects on polar regions, particularly in the Arctic and Antarctica. Rising temperatures lead to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, which contributes to rising sea levels. This melting threatens the habitats of polar animals, such as polar bears, seals, and penguins, which depend on ice for survival. Additionally, the loss of ice reduces the Earth's albedo, causing more solar radiation to be absorbed and further increasing temperatures.</p> Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases like methane, exacerbating global warming.",

During the United States involvement in the Vietnam War , American flags were sometimes burned during war protest demonstrations . After the Johnson decision , the Flag Protection Act was passed protecting flags from anyone who `` mutilates , defaces , physically defiles , burns , maintains on the floor or ground , or tramples upon any flag '' . This decision was later struck down in the Eichman decision . After that case , several flag burning amendments to the Constitution were proposed . On 22 June 2005 , a Flag Desecration Amendment was passed by the House with the needed two - thirds majority . On 27 June 2006 , another attempt to pass a ban on flag burning was rejected by the Senate in a close vote of 66 in favor , 34 opposed , one vote short of the two - thirds",
